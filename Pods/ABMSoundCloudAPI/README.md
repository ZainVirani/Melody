## Motivation

Since SoundCloud decided not to maintain anymore its API iOS library I decided to create my own one. Right now just support some of the API's endpoints such as:
* Authentication usign internal webview.
* Searching for songs given a query string.
* Download a song given the stream URL.
* Get User Playlists.
* Get Playlists given playlist ID.
* Get song info given song ID.
* Follow user given user ID.

## Usage

* To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
* How to upload audio file to soundcloud (this is basic example with basic meta information)

```objective-c
    NSDictionary *params = @{
                             @"track[title]": @"title",
                             @"track[permalink]": @"permalink", //lowercase is must
                             @"track[tag_list]": @"tag", //lowercaset is must
                             @"triack[sharing]": @"public",
                             @"track[downloadable]": @YES
                             };
    
    
    [[ABMSoundCloudAPISingleton sharedManager].soundCloudPort uploadAudioFile:fileData mimeType:@"audio/mp4" meta:params withSuccess:^(NSDictionary *songDict) {
    
        NSLog(@"success");
    
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
    
        NSLog(@"error");
        
    }];
```
